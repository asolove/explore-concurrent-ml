# Concurrent Programming in (Reason)ML

## What is this?

An exploration of the concurrency primitives from Concurrent ML.

The code in this repository is primarily examples from the book
"Concurrent Programming in ML" by John Reppy. The examples have
been translated to the version of the [`Event` module](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Event.html)
available as part of the OCaml standard library and to the syntax
of [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason/index.html).
